"""Machine Learning / NLP pipeline for petition analysis.

Implements a lightweight TF-IDF + cosine similarity classifier in pure
Python (no external ML deps required), plus rule-based sentiment and
priority detection. This keeps the backend runnable out-of-the-box while
still performing genuine NLP (tokenization, stopword filtering, TF-IDF
weighting, similarity scoring).
